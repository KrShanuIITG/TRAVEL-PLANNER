# Travel-Planner

Identifies least travel time path between two cities using dijkstra's algorithm.
Built a website that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the least time-taking path between two
cities using at most 1 airplane given a network of cities connected by bus and airplane routes.
Visualized graph using open source library vis.js. Each new problem generates a random
network between 10 cities.
